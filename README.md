### About this Project
I enjoyed doing this project because i learned a lot through the process. One of the biggest issues i overcame with this project was not knowing many of the CSS properties that can style the page i wanted. Through the process, I learned many new properties and html code that gave me the foundation i have. The project ended up well done, but I will be making continuous improvements as my schedule permits me to.
